# Breast Cancer End-to-End Machine Learning Pipeline

An end-to-end machine learning project demonstrating the complete ML lifecycle —
from model training and experiment tracking to deployment as a live application.

---

## 🔍 Problem Statement
Predict whether a breast tumor is **Benign** or **Malignant** using diagnostic
features derived from medical imaging data.

This is a binary classification problem with real-world healthcare relevance.

---

## 🧠 Machine Learning Pipeline

1. Data ingestion using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset (sklearn)
2. Train-test split and preprocessing
3. Training multiple ML models:
   - Logistic Regression
   - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
   - Random Forest
   - Gradient Boosting
4. Experiment tracking and comparison using **MLflow**
5. Best model selection based on evaluation metrics
6. Model serialization using `joblib`
7. Inference pipeline for unseen data
8. Deployment using **Gradio + Hugging Face Spaces**

---

## 🚀 Live Deployment

The trained model is deployed as an interactive web application:

🔗 **Hugging Face Space**  
https://huggingface.co/spaces/shrutithakkar/breast_cancer_prediction

Users can input feature values and receive real-time predictions.
